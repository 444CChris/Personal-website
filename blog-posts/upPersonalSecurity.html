			<p>“Protect Your Privacy”. This headline in a pamphlet at Seattle’s BSides conference this year (2025)
				reminded me of my own faults. Though I spent most of my freshman year familiarizing myself with the
				cybersecurity world, I neglected my own personal security far beyond hope. It is with great sadness that
				I inform you that I was using the same password for everything, sensitive and non sensitive accounts
				alike. This summer I decided to put a good effort into changing that and created a list that I think
				encompasses basic security goals that set some sort of standard for self preservation.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="#password-manager">Use a password manager and unique passwords</a></li>
				<li> <a href="#alias'">use different alias’ for professional and non professional accounts</a></li>
				<li><a href="#data-brokers">Opt out of Data Broker’s so they can’t spread your personal information</a>
				</li>
				<li><a href="#freeze-credit">Freeze your credit until you need it</a></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Then We have some extra items that I wanted to tick off for myself.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="#VPN">Have VPN’s or Tor on hand</a> </li>
				<li><a href="#proton">Look into migrating to proton from google</a></li>
				<li><a href="#Graphene">Use Graphene OS on my phone</a></li>
			</ul>
			<section id="password-manager">
				<p>
					To start, I focused on the most critical item according to my threat model, my password and account
					situation. I knew that I had been exposed in multiple online attacks thanks to <a
						href=”https://haveibeenpwned.com/”> haveibeenpwned </a> so it was a long overdue patch I needed
					to make.
					There are plenty of password managers out there, but for privacy and security reason’s I’m not going
					to be
					sharing which one I used. Some popular ones recommended by security folks are <a
						href="https://bitwarden.com/">Bitwarden</a>, <a
						href="https://support.1password.com/explore/get-started/">1Password</a>, and
					<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/109016">iCloudKeychain</a>, they all vary slightly but do
					the same job at the end of the day. After having migrated all
					my account information to a password manager I began sifting through each password. I knew that I
					had been
					lazy in the past and had not used generated passwords, instead opting for the same password. It was a
					matter
					of basically ctrl+f’ing my own list of passwords to see which ones were the same and  then tediously change them one by one. To be clear
					this predicament was totally my own fault, but thankfully it took about 5 hours to compelete my goals of more secure password management. 
				</p>

				<section id="alias'">
					<p>Then, I changed most of my public social media handles to be unique alias’ as
						having multiple alias’ protects my online privacy and my employability. This step was about 2 hours of work.</p>
				</section>
			</section>
			<section id="data-brokers">
				<p>
					The next step to my plan was opting myself out of databroker’s databases. Originally, I wanted to go
					through
					each data broker and manually request for my information to be taken down. Quickly, however, I
					realized how
					slow their processing of requests was, and how most of the information (the URL) needed to take down
					my own
					listing was behind a morally questionable paywall. So instead of visiting sites like <a href="https://www.spokeo.com/">Spokeo</a>,
					<a href="https://www.whitepages.com/">Whitepages</a>, and
					<a href="https://www.peoplefinders.com/">Peoplefinders</a> one by one I decided to pay a fee to a third party to automate the process. The fee was
					miniscule compared to the amount I would have to pay each site to view my own information, and
					automated
					what would have been a week long task into a few minutes. Services like <a
						href="https://www.deleteme.com/">DeleteMe</a> or <a
						href="https://privacyduck.com/">PrivacyDuck</a> are great
					options for doing this, but if you have the time and are up for the struggle, manually requesting
					removal
					from these sites is an option.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="freeze-credit">
				<p>
					Finally, freezing my credit was surprisingly easy. You need to create accounts for the 3 credit
					reporting
					agencies, <a
						href="https://www.equifax.com/personal/credit-report-services/credit-freeze/">Equifax</a>, <a
						href="https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/credit-education/preventing-fraud/security-freeze/">Experian</a>,
					and <a href="https://www.transunion.com/credit-freeze">TransUnion</a>, and you click “freeze” on your
					credit. Very simple and easy, took
					me about 15 minutes to do.</p>
			</section>
			<img src="../assets/blog/upSecurity/FreezeCredit.png" alt="Logos of the three largest credti reporting agencies, Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion.">

			<section id="VPN">
				<p>
					The extra steps to my plan were a combination of time consuming tasks and trivial ones thankfully!
					The
					trivial ones included downloading <a href="https://protonvpn.com/">Proton’s VPN</a> and <a
						href="https://www.torproject.org/download/">Tor</a> on my devices. </p>
				<section id="proton">
					<p>A more time consuming task was looking
						further into the proton ecosystem, which I eventually decided was not for me due to most of the
						more
						enticing features being locked behind a paywall, which I as a broke college student cannot
						afford
						unfortunately. In the future I will definitely consider a legitimate switch to proton’s
						ecosystem, but
						google’s ecosystem has the benefits of being free and convenient for now.</p>

			<section id="Graphene">
				<p>
					The best and most dire change I saved for last - <a href="https://grapheneos.org/">Graphene OS</a>.
					To be honest, this part was marketed to me by
					a few friends in my university’s cybersecurity club, and I was pretty sold. Installing and flashing
					Graphene
					onto my phone wasn’t too hard, but the most tedious part was installing every single app. Graphene
					chooses
					to compile apps themselves because of privacy concerns with JIT (Just in Time). Despite this, the
					technical
					issues weren’t that bad. For the most part, the only change I really noticed was having to enable a
					lot more
					app permissions. For instance, banking apps have to have a permission turned on called “Exploit
					protection
					compatibility mode” which is used to help sandbox apps to prevent severe exploits from occurring. The
					upsides
					to having Graphene over an out-of-the-box OS are far greater than the downsides in my opinion. Since
					installing it I’ve explored the privacy features such as duress pins, automatic bluetooth and NFC
					disableling, USB-C port permissions, and auto reboot times.</p>

				To conclude my journey of upping my own personal security, I invite you to think about ways you can
				upgrade
				your own personal security. I think at the top of the list password managers are the most important, but
				things like freezing your credit or trying to opt out of data brokers can also be worth your time. For
				me,
				my next steps are maintaining my personal security by continuing to use the password manager I have and
				to
				always stop and think before creating a new account or downloading a new app. In the future I’d like
				to
				fully exit google’s online ecosystem and maybe Homelab my own ad blocker or firewall!

				Thank you so much for reading my little side quest of improving personal security, and as a side note
				I’m
				currently working on an <a href="https://github.com/444CChris/MysticMessage">encrypted messaging app</a>
				so be on the look out for that in the near future!
				<br>
				<br>With my heart,
				<br>Chris
